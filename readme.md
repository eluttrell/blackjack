#Blackjack!

##Description:

For this project my teammate Keyur Patel @ekeyur and I built a Blackjack game using HTML, CSS, and Javascript with jQuery.
This is a constant work in progress that will probably be in a constant state of change.

##Usage:

If you know the basic rules for blackjack (which I admitedly was a bit shaky on at the start of the project)
