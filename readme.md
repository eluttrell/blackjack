#Blackjack!

##Description:

For this project my teammate Keyur Patel and I built a Blackjack game using HTML, CSS, and Javascript with jQuery.
This is a constant work in progress that will probably be in a constant state of change.

##Usage:

If you know the basic rules for blackjack (which I admittedly was a bit shaky on at the start of the project), then it is pretty straight forward. We plan on adding more and more functionality and styling as time goes on.

##Contributing

Mentioned above, this project was started by Keyur Patel and myself, Elijah Allstrom-Luttrell. We have a shared project on Keyur's github page (which can be found at [Keyur's Page](http://github.com/ekeyur/blackjack.git))

##History

We started the project with functions, based on TDD tests provided by our instructor. Once we had that up and running we switched gears and wrote some of our own TDD tests in jasmine and built up Objects and Methods to do what our functions had been doing previously. We then refactored the project and made it OOP based, and proceeded forward with future changes being OOP based as well.
